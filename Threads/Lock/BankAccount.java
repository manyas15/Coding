// Without it: If you just catch InterruptedException and do nothing, the thread “forgets” it was interrupted because the flag resets to false automatically.

// With it: You preserve the interruption status, so other parts of the program can detect that the thread was told to stop.
// 💡 Think of isInterrupted() like checking “Has someone tapped me on the shoulder saying ‘Stop whatever you’re doing’?”
// It doesn’t stop your thread automatically — it’s just a flag you can check.
